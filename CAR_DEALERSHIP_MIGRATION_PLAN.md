## Implementation Order Recommendation

1. **Phase 1** - Foundation for all other work
2. **Phase 2** - Core vehicle management functionality
3. **Phase 3** - Customer-facing lead generation features
4. **Phase 5** - Enhanced discovery before service features
5. **Phase 4** - After-sales service department
6. **Phase 6** - Analytics after data generation
7. **Phase 7** - Final polish and integration

Alternative: Phases 4 and 5 can be swapped depending on whether service department or search/comparison is higher priority.

## Risk Mitigation

### Data Migration Risks
- **Risk**: Data loss during migration
- **Mitigation**: Complete backup before each phase, rollback plan, test migrations on copies

### User Adoption Risks
- **Risk**: Staff resistance to new system
- **Mitigation**: Comprehensive training, phased rollout, feedback loops

### Technical Risks
- **Risk**: Integration failures with external APIs
- **Mitigation**: Fallback options, graceful degradation, thorough testing

### Performance Risks
- **Risk**: System slowdown with large inventory
- **Mitigation**: Performance testing, optimization early, scalable architecture

## Next Steps

1. Review and approve this plan
2. Prioritize phases based on business needs
3. Begin Phase 1 implementation
4. Schedule regular progress reviews
5. Gather feedback after each phase
6. Adjust subsequent phases based on learnings

## Notes

- Each phase is designed to be independently valuable
- Phases can be adjusted based on feedback
- Token budgets are estimates and may vary
- Additional features can be added in future phases
- System will remain functional throughout migration
- All existing data will be preserved
